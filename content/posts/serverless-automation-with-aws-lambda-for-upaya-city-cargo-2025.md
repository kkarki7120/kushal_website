Company Background Upaya City Cargo is Nepal’s leading digital logistics and supply chain platform, providing on-demand and intercity delivery services through technology-driven solutions. Operating across multiple cities with thousands of driver partners, Upaya connects businesses and customers for seamless cargo movement, aiming to become the backbone of Digital Nepal’s logistics infrastructure with serverless automation. As Upaya’s operations expanded, managing large volumes of transactions, real-time tracking updates, and asynchronous system events became increasingly complex. The engineering team sought a scalable, automated, and cost-efficient backend that could process millions of daily events without manual intervention or infrastructure overhead.
